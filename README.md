FreshFind is an app that both helps people find recipes for their indgredient and farmers markets nearby where they might shop at. Using the Spoontastic API, we are able to display three recipes to the user based on the ingredient they searched for. The USDA Farmer's Market API along with Google Maps, allow people find markets close to their location based on zipcode. This way, users can see where they can buy local, fresh food, then explore various recipes that could be created from the desired ingredient.
